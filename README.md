Analysis of Risk Factors for the Onset of Diabetes in Women

The primary goal of this analysis is to explore and understand the factors contributing to diabetes
onset among female patients using a comprehensive dataset of diagnostic health measurements.
This focus is especially important given the historical underrepresentation of this demographic in
medical research and clinical trials. Women possess unique physiological characteristics and risk
factors that differ from men, yet many studies have traditionally generalized findings across
genders without considering these differences. This often results in a lack of tailored healthcare
recommendations and less effective prevention strategies.
By centering our analysis on data from female patients, we aim to fill a critical gap in diabetes
research, particularly in the context of diabetes. This includes:

    ● Identifying trends and patterns in the health measurements of women diagnosed with diabetes compared to those without the condition.

    ● Determining which diagnostic features, such as glucose levels, BMI, and blood pressure strongly correlate with the likelihood of developing diabetes.

    ● Exploring the relationship between family history, as represented by the diabetesPedigreeFunction, and diabetes risk within this dataset.

By answering these questions, this analysis seeks to contribute valuable insights to improve
healthcare strategies and outcomes for women.
